These are supposed to be a date-time table, each datum following the hh:mm format. But some have random characters or digits glued to them, such as in the case 312:40, which is supposed to be 12:40, or the times are glued together, although being right otherwise. Fix this and make them separated by one space. Some lines represent rest days 'folga', 'ferias', 'feriado' and should be replaced by FOLGA, they generally don't contain ':', and contain letters in FOLGA. It will be clear that there is a progression along the working day, and it is your job to induct that regularity - please note that it is only an interval regularity, not numerical sameness or repetition, and infer what sort of correction is needed. Separate the times by line breaks, and leave only one date-time for each line. Mind if the data does starts with a FOLGA - if there is FOLGA-related text just before the times.
